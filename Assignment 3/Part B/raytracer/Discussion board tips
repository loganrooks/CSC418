TIPS FROM THE DISCUSSION BOARD:

RESOLUTION AND NUMBER OF IMAGES:
For testing purposes you can use any resolution you want. But for final submission we advise to use the highest resolution 
possible (depends how much time you have to render). 640x480 is a good start.
Include as many images as possible to demonstrate the effect. 1-3 images per effect is enough.
for secondary reflections and hard shadows i would suggest at least 2.

EPSILON IN SHADOW IMAGES??:
Shadow rays without an Epsilon makes the image very noisy. 
Is there an appropriate value to use or should we just choose one that gives satisfactory results?

Whatever works, just make sure it's very small

SOFT SHADOWS/EXTENDED LIGHT SOURCES:
Do we just need to add multiple additional point light sources for extended light sources? 
Yes you can simulate area light source as a collection of point light sources like a grid.

Does showing soft shadows count as finishing this feature?
Yes

REFLECTION:
use fresnel's law for reflection and refraction

NOISE ISSUE:
When you create a ray with starting point o=(x,y,z) then its best to add a very tiny offset in the direction of the ray.
For example if your direction is d then offset can be m*d where m < 0.001 and then the starting point becomes o+m*d

Try that and see if it solves the problem.

TEXTURE MAPPING ARTIFACTS:
The built-in bmp_io has some issue in reading and will produce above result.
I used following approach to avoid this:

Open your bmp file in GIMP
Export the bmp with the following options:
Compatibility Options -> Do not write color space information
Advanced Options -> 24 bits R8 G8 B8

TRANSPARENCY:
You can make your objects have a transparency (like an alpha channel) and then mix their usual colour
with the transparency. So if it was a yellow object with 0.5 transparency, it would be a yellow translucent object.
